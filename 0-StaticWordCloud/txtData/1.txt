#Buttigieg who failed  fixing potholes in South Bend is our #incompetent Secretary of Transportation overseeing $1.2 Trillion budget. He is #clueless but #PotHolePete does  believe in “Equity”, having more #minorities fixing bridges, roads, rail etc. which are NOT getting fixed😂  https://t.co/9ZOFgziCia
