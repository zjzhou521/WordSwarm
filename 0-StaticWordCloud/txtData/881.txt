US President #Biden issues EO to move $3.5bn in Afghan central bank assets frozen in US financial institutions into a consolidated account "for the benefit of the Afghan people". Da #Afghanistan Bank reportedly rejects the EO, citing "irrelevant" purposes:  https://t.co/JzlgL0s2zn  https://t.co/FxUDtHurbn

Folks are ignoring Obama &amp; the @CIA involvement in this; Trump won't say anything bc he's afraid of the @CIA &amp; sold his soul to the right-wing faction of that agency; hence, Killary is getting all the blame #CIA #DeepState #Coup #Trump #HillaryClinton #Obama

When discussing the full economy my suggestion was to get an economist as opposed to an analyst. The inflation issue is not as simple as those looking for easy answers or a reason to attack #Biden policy, make it. Not talking about Jerome Powell, who IMO is not doing his job
#Biden nun Problem mit Terminkalender , weil  #Russland Man√∂ver beenden will. Angriffspl√§ne gab es ohnehin nie ! Entwicklung passt nat√ºrlich vielen Scharfmachern gegen Russland nicht. Z.B. #Gr√ºne #USA Freunde hatten doch schon auf Sanktionen gehofft um #Nordstream2 zu erledigen.

La crisi tra #ucrainarussia si appiana ma stoltenberg √® ancora dubbioso : #NATO e #Biden, che prevedeva l'attacco per domani, sembrano attapirati e tutt'altro che soddisfatti.
Ma se il #Covid_19 finisce e #Putin non invade l'#Ucraina, gettando la Gran Bretagna e #Biden nello sconforto, poi i giornali di che cavolo parlano? Mafia, morti sul #lavoro ed emergenza climatica non vendono.
Recordemos, en diciembre del a√±o pasado, #Putin, ya hab√≠a exigido a #Biden garant√≠as de que la #OTAN no avanzar√≠a, de la misma manera le hizo menci√≥n de los intentos de la OTAN por conquistar territorio ucraniano buscando aumentar su potencial militar...   https://t.co/MNFJ09wxBN

#Biden r√©affirme son engagement envers une politique de #Y√©men d√©faillante.  L'approche de son administration dans la r√©cente escalade du conflit suit le m√™me ancien sc√©nario que par le pass√©, risquant une coop√©ration suppl√©mentaire dans les crimes #Saoudiens et #√âAU.  @drzarni
