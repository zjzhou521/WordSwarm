64% of white voters and 66% of Black voters say allegations that #Clinton spied on Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign are "worse than watergate." #RasmussenPoll
The problem isn't that #DonaldTrump is a clown...

The problem is that too many Americans really want to go to the circus.
Dear #JoeBiden,

If such a view was salient then it would give rise to potentially healthy redeeming response options.

@afneil Remember when the Dems were accusing Trump of Russian collusion… well… I’d argue #JoeBiden has done more for Russia by simply being fuckin braindead than Trump ever could have.
#hartaberfair man kann ja von #Trump halten was man will unter unter ihm war die Weltpolitik sicherer. Das mal sachlich formuliert. #Putin hat einen Großmacht Anspruch aber unter #Biden wird nur die Politik umgesetzt, die es damals schon unter Hillary #Clinton gegeben hätte.
