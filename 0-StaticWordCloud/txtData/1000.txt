Yes! Of course! Insanity of the day: VP @VP Harris tweets from the official Farsi account how racist the #US is. Seriously? ✅  It seems at every step the #Biden admin is self sabotaging when it comes to #Iran  https://t.co/iHC7Jy62qr
Just whistleblowing-  Political ads here are literally using phrases like Candidate X chosen by President Trump.  CHOSEN BY  One more time 👏🏻CHOSEN👏🏻BY.  That should NEVER be part of a candidates ad campaign.  #DNC #Biden #Trump #Jan6thInsurrection
Gonna go out on a limb here, and guess that no one in Congress will stand up and demand to know, “Who’s gonna pay for this?” before ultimately voting for #Biden’s catastrophic $770 billion defense budget. #Medicare not bombs.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argues that President Biden isn't using his executive powers enough, urges him to cancel student loans..#Biden..#studentdebt..
@NewYorkStateAG Oh and by the way, you're trying to keep Trump out of the White House again. Obama has said she will not run, Hillary Clinton will be running for the border, And Biden will not even know where he's at in 2024 #Trump #Biden #BidenIsALaughingstock  https://t.co/ddWGhjJd7V

You know it’s bad when 95% of the media is behind you and you still score a 35% approval rating. Maybe it’s -The record inflation? -The wide-open border? the 2 million illegal aliens he let into the country? Maybe it was the $80 billion in arms he left the Taliban? #Biden
Wonder What Build Back Better Looks Like? See California by @Jimbreslo  #Biden has not given up on his #BuildBackBetter bill, despite Joe Manchin repeatedly stating it dead.  https://t.co/QWCS7guPJc

#Trudeau apparently was the one who talked #Biden into the covid passports. If so That’s a direct interference in America’s freedom. This was BEFORE the #Truckersforfreedomconvoy2022   #TrudeauTyranny has affected Americans.  So we’ll keep funding #FreedomConvoyCanada2022 🇺🇸

I've said that I believe #joebiden is the probably dumbest president we've ever had, but I'd like to take it a step further. I believe #Biden is the dumbest person who also wears a suit and tie to work
@KremlinRussia_E   Make smart decisions over the next 48 hours. Don’t mess with anyone Americans are associated with. America will always be there swiftly and intolerant. Don’t play with us. 🇺🇸  #music #love #Russia #RussiaUkraine #Trump #donjr #TheTrumps #Biden

It is no coincidence that the lower @JoeBiden has fallen in the polls the louder the war drums beat.   #UkraineRussiaCrisis #Ukraine #Russia #Putin #Biden #NoWar
@francescocosta Mezzo mondo ha fatto il diavolo a quattro affinché fosse eletto #Biden. Trump non era sicuramente il miglior presidente eleggibile all'epoca.  Si credeva di aver toccato il fondo. Forse con la successiva elezione di Joe il fondo del barile lo stiamo veramente raschiando.  😓🙈🤦‍♂️

@AaronParnas I think it was Trump who said if #Biden was elected #NATO would have us in a war within a year. Hot dignity dog that prediction was spot on like him or not. 😂
