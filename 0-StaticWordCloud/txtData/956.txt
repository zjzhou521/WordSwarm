Folks freaking out about a Black #SCOTUS nominee because Black folks are minorites, just "13% of the US population," are the same people who claim that the filibuster is necessary to preserve the rights of the (Whyte) conservative minority #SupremeCourt #Biden #BlackTwitter

Except that #Biden has already said that minor incursions are ok, didn't define what that was, then changed his mind, and now nobody knows what US policy on what constitutes an invasion of #Ukraine actually is.
#Durham‚Äôs investigation continues to drop bombshells. First, we learned that the 2016 #Clinton campaign paid a tech firm to infiltrate servers in #Trump Tower and later to monitor Trump in the White House.   This was supposed to create a viable #Russiagate narrative.

Hello @NATO. Will you do likewise to Russia? #Ukraine Ukraine is not a member. It takes a long process and time for any country to apply. So. It would be years before they could be a member. Attack Putin and his land with #cyber attacks also. #WW3 #GERMANY #GASLINE #BIDEN

‚ÄúThe report also criticized the #trade deal signed by the #Trump administration, in one of the first written assessments the #Biden administration has provided of #China‚Äôs progress toward the terms set out in that deal.‚Äùü§î
#Biden and #CDC may relax #mandates soon, according to him. AGAIN I predict he is waiting to do it at #StateOfTheUnion. Obviously for political reasons. Meanwhile, some are losing jobs because of the mandates. #BidenIsALaughingstock  @FoxNews @Gutfeldfox @BillHemmer @DanaPerino  https://t.co/ZCcZ8eTYyN
‚ÄúThe #Biden administration has said it intends to hold #China to the terms of that agreement, while also calling for a different approach to #trade. But it has not clarified just how assertively it would enforce a deal it has described as fundamentally flawed.‚Äùü§Ø
The country is on the right track. Most people I‚Äôm talking to, feel the economy is strong and business owners have jobs but there are no workers. #Biden #boom #economy @POTUS @WhiteHouse

When I see someone use the term "negative reinforcement", they are often wrong. It's not the same as punishment. It is when you remove something unpleasant as a reward, such as removing #Trump because you voted for #Biden. üòé
