Also a quick reminder, despite the controversial figure of #Donald #Trump, he is the president who started the least wars (0) and invaded the least countries (0). Every other so-called "liberal" such as #Obama and #Biden, as well as republicans like #Bush were warmongers. Sorry.
#Hillary was right about most things, except when she said about half of #Trump were deplorables. The percentage is much high than 50. #hillarywasright #HillaryWasRightAboutEverything #TrumpCult https://t.co/z0V96ZmVZ8

@DavidAFrench It's time for America and the West to stand strong against #Trump ally #VladimirPutin.
